# Controllers

## 3.1. AccountPool Controller

The `AccountPool` controller is triggered by a create or change operation to an `AccountPool` CR or an `Account` CR. It is responsible for filling the `AccountPool` by generating new `Account` CRs.

The controller looks at the desired `AccountPool` CR `spec.poolSize` and it ensures that the number of unclaimed accounts matches the number of the defined poolsize. If the number of unclaimed accounts is less than the poolsize it creates a new `Account` CR for the `Account` controller to process.

### 3.1.1. Constants and Globals

```go
emailID = "osd-creds-mgmt"
```

### 3.1.2. Status

Updates accountPool CR

```yaml
  claimedAccounts: 4
  poolSize: 3
  unclaimedAccounts: 3
```

* `claimedAccounts` are any accounts with the `status.Claimed=true`.
* `unclaimedAccounts` are any accounts with `status.Claimed=false` and `status.State!="Failed"`.
* `poolSize` is the poolsize from the `AccountPool` spec.

### 3.1.3. Metrics

Updated in the AccountPool controller:

```txt
MetricTotalAccountCRs
MetricTotalAccountCRsUnclaimed
MetricTotalAccountCRsClaimed
MetricTotalAccountPendingVerification
MetricTotalAccountCRsFailed
MetricTotalAccountCRsReady
MetricTotalAccountClaimCRs
```

## 3.2. Account Controller

The `Account` controller is triggered by creating or changing an `Account` CR. It is responsible for the following behaviors:

If the **awsLimit** set in the constants is not exceeded:

1. Creates a new account in the organization belonging to credentials in secret `aws-account-operator-credentials`
2. Configures two AWS IAM users from `iamUserNameUHC` and `iamUserNameSRE` as their respective usernames
    - Creates IAM user in new account
    - Attaches Admin policy
    - Generates a secret access key for the user
    - Stores user secret in an AWS secret
3. Creates STS CLI tokens
    - Creates Federated web console URL using the `iamUserNameSRE` user
4. Creates and Destroys EC2 instances
5. Creates AWS support case to increase account limits

**Note:**
* `iamUserNameUHC` is used by Hive to provision clusters
* `iamUserNameSRE` is used to generate Federated console URL

### 3.2.1. Additional Functionality

- If `status.RotateCredentials == true` the account-controller will refresh the STS Cli Credentials.
- If the account's `status.State == "Creating"` and the account is older than the `createPendTime` constant the account will be put into a `failed` state.
- If the account's `status.State == AccountReady && spec.ClaimLink != ""` it sets `status.Claimed = true`.

### 3.2.2. Constants and Globals

```go
iamUserNameUHC          = "osdManagedAdmin"
iamUserNameSRE          = "osdManagedAdminSRE"
awsSecretName           = "aws-account-operator-credentials"
awsInstanceType         = "t2.micro"
createPendTime          = 10 * time.Minute

// Fields used to create/monitor AWS case
caseCategoryCode              = "other-account-issues"
caseServiceCode               = "customer-account"
caseIssueType                 = "customer-service"
caseSeverity                  = "high"
caseDesiredInstanceLimit      = 25
caseStatusResolved            = "resolved"
intervalAfterCaseCreationSecs = 30
intervalBetweenChecksSecs     = 30

// AccountPending indicates an account is pending
AccountPending = "Pending"
// AccountCreating indicates an account is being created
AccountCreating = "Creating"
// AccountFailed indicates account creation has failed
AccountFailed = "Failed"
// AccountReady indicates account creation is ready
AccountReady = "Ready"
// AccountPendingVerification indicates verification (of AWS limits and Enterprise Support) is pending
AccountPendingVerification = "PendingVerification"
// IAM Role name for IAM user creating resources in account
accountOperatorIAMRole = "OrganizationAccountAccessRole"

var awsAccountID string
var desiredInstanceType = "m5.xlarge"
var coveredRegions = []string{
    "us-east-1",
    "us-east-2",
    "us-west-1",
    "us-west-2",
    "ca-central-1",
    "eu-central-1",

    "ap-south-1",
    "ap-southeast-1",
    "ap-southeast-2",
    "sa-east-1",
}
```

### 3.2.3. Spec

Updates the Account CR

```yaml
spec:
  awsAccountID: "000000112120"
  claimLink: "claim-name"
  iamUserSecret: accountName-secret
```

* `awsAccountID` is updated with the account ID of the AWS account that is created by the `Account` controller.
* `claimLink` holds the name of the `AccountClaim` that has claimed this `Account` CR.
* `iamUserSecret` holds the name of the secret containing IAM user credentials for the AWS account.

### 3.2.4. Status

Updates the Account CR:

```yaml
status:
  claimed: false
  conditions:
  - lastProbeTime: 2019-07-18T22:04:38Z
    lastTransitioNTime: 2019-07-18T22:04:38Z
    message: Attempting to create account
    reason: Creating
    status: "True"
    type: Creating
  rotateCredentials: false
  state: Failed
  supportCaseID: "00000000"
```

**state** can be any of the account states defined in the constants below:

- `AccountPending` indicates an account is pending.
- `AccountCreating` indicates an account is being created.
- `AccountFailed` indicates account creation has failed.
- `AccountReady` indicates account creation is ready.
- `AccountPendingVerification` indicates verification (of AWS limits and Enterprise Support) is pending.

* `claimed` is true if `currentAcctInstance.Status.State == AccountReady && currentAcctInstance.Spec.ClaimLink != "`
* `rotateCredentials` updated by the secretwatcher pkg which will set the bool to true triggering an reconcile of this controller to rotate the STS credentials.
* `supportCaseID` is the ID of the aws support case to increase limits
`conditions` indicates the last state the account had and supporting details.

## 3.3. AccountClaim Controller

The `AccountClaim` controller is triggered when an `AccountClaim` CR is created in any namespace. It is responsible for the following behaviors:

1. Sets account `spec.ClaimLink` to the name of the `AccountClaim`
2. Sets `AccountClaim` `spec.AccountLink` to the name of an unclaimed Account
3. Creates a secret in the `AccountClaim` namespace that contains the credentials tied to the aws account in the `Account` CR
4. Sets `AccountClaim` `status.State = "Ready"`
5. Delinks `AccountClaim ` from  and`Account` to enable the Account to be reused (non-CCS cases)
6. Cleans up the AWS resources when an `AccountClaim` is delinked

### 3.3.1. Reuse/Cleanup Workflow

An `Account` can come either from the reused pool (it's going to be there for a long time, that's why you see old AGE) or be a new account that is part of the `AccountPool`.
The first time we assign an account to this `AccountClaim`, we copy the `legalEntity` from the `AccountClaim` CR to the `Account` CR.
From now on, this `Account` is marked with that specific `legalEntity` id, and it does not go away when we delete the cluster.

It will go away only when we do a cleanup of accounts. So, the reuse workflow reuses accounts from the same legalEntity id.
We do not want an external customer to use an account, delete it, and then this account gets assigned to another cluster for another customer.
Consequently, for security reasons, we reuse accounts only from the same legal entity id.

The following diagram illustrates how the `AccountClaim` controller does the reuse and cleanup of resources.

![Operator Reuse Cleanup Workflow](images/reuse-cleanup-workflow.png)

As you can see in the diagram, depending on the environment (CCS/Non-CCS) it performs differently. Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated (OSD) provides a [Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS)](https://www.openshift.com/dedicated/ccs) model that allows Red Hat to deploy and manage OpenShift Dedicated into a customer's AWS account. Reuse does not apply to CCS environments since we cannot reuse the `Account`s of the customers. It's their environment, and they own the payer account.
However, in non-CCS environments that Red Hat manages, the `Account`s can be reused.

When an `AccountClaim` CR is being deleted, the `AccountClaim` CR either deletes the `Account` CR in a CCS environment or delinks the `AccountClaim` and lets the `Account` CR be reused in a non-CCS environment.

During reconciliation, after an `AccountClaim` CR is deleted, the controller also cleans up the resources in Amazon Web Services.
In the case of CCS environments, it deletes the IAM resources, while in non-CCS environments, it cleans up resources such as EBS Snapshots, S3 Buckets, and Route53 entries.


### 3.3.2. Constants and Globals

```go
AccountClaimed          = "AccountClaimed"
AccountUnclaimed        = "AccountUnclaimed"
awsCredsUserName        = "aws_user_name"
awsCredsAccessKeyID     = "aws_access_key_id"
awsCredsSecretAccessKey = "aws_secret_access_key"
```

### 3.3.3. Spec

Updates the `AccountClaim CR`:

```yaml
spec:
  accountLink: osd-{accountName}
  aws:
    regions:
    - name: us-east-1
  awsCredentialSecret:
    name: aws
    namespace: {NameSpace}
  legalEntity:
    id: 00000000000000
    name: {Legal Entity Name}
```

* `awsCredentialSecret` holds the name and namespace of the secret with the credentials created for the `AccountClaim`.

### 3.3.4. Status

Updates the `AccountClaim` CR

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
    - lastProbeTime: 2019-07-16T13:52:02Z
      lastTransitionTime: 2019-07-16T13:52:02Z
    message: Attempting to claim account
    reason: AccountClaimed
    status: "True"
    type: Unclaimed
    - lastProbeTime: 2019-07-16T13:52:03Z
      lastTransitionTime: 2019-07-16T13:52:03Z
    message: Account claimed by osd-creds-mgmt-fhq2d2
    reason: AccountClaimed
    status: "True"
    type: Claimed
    state: Ready
```

* `state` can be any of the ClaimStatus strings defined in [accountclaim_types.go](https://github.com/openshift/aws-account-operator/blob/master/pkg/apis/aws/v1alpha1/accountclaim_types.go#L84)
* `conditions` indicates the last state the account had and supporting details

### 3.3.5. Metrics

## 3.4 AWSFederatedRole Controller

The `AWSFederatedRole` controller is triggered when an [`AWSFederatedRole`](https://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation/) is created in any namespace. It is responsible for the following behaviors:

1. Building AWS `Policy` Doc from `Role` definition in the spec.
2. Attempting to validate the Role in AWS by creating the `Role`, and deleting it if successful.
3. Setting the status to `Valid` or `Failed`.
4. If the status is `Valid` or `Failed`, stop all reconciling.
5. If an `AWSFederatedRole` is deleted, cleaning up any instances of the Role in AWS by cleaning up any `AWSFederatedAccountAccesses` using the `AWSFederatedRole`.

### 3.4.1. Constants and Globals

None

### 3.4.2. Spec

```yaml
spec:
  roleDisplayName: Example Role
  roleDescription: This is an example Role
  # Custom Policy definition
  awsCustomPolicy:
    name:  ExampleCustomPolicy
    description: Description of Example Custom Policy
    # list of statements for the policy
    awsStatements:
      - effect: Allow
        action:
        - "aws-portal:ViewAccount"
        - "aws-portal:ViewBilling"
        resource:
        - "*"
  # list of  AWS managed
  awsManagedPolicies:
   - "AWSAccountUsageReportAccess"
   - "AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess"
   - "AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess"
   - "IAMReadOnlyAccess"
```
* `roleDisplayName` is a human-readable name for the Role.
* `roleDescription` is a human-readable description of what the Role does.
* `awsCustomPolicy` is a representation of an [AWS Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) to be created as part of the Role. It contains a Policy name, a description, and a list of AWS Statements which `Allow` or `Deny` specific actions on specific resources.
* `awsManagedPolicies` is a list of [AWS pre-defined policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) to add to the Role.

### 3.4.3. Status
```yaml
  conditions:
  - lastProbeTime: {Time Stamp}
    lastTransitionTime: {Time Stamp}
    message: All managed and custom policies are validated
    reason: AllPoliciesValid
    status: "True"
    type: Valid
  state: Valid
```

* `conditions` indicates the last states the `AWSFederatedRole` had and supporting details. In general, for `AWSFederatedRoles`, only one condition is expected, and it should match the state.
* `state` is the current state of the CR. Possible values are `Valid` and `Failed`.

### 3.4.4. Metrics

None

## 3.5 AWSFederatedAccountAccess Controller

The `AWSFederatedAccountAccess` controller is triggered when an `AccountClaim` is created in any namespace. It is responsible for the following behaviors:

1. Ensures the requested `AWSFederatedRole` exists.
2. Converts the `AWSFederatedRole` spec into an AWS `Policy` Doc.
3. Creates a unique AWS `Role` in the AWS containing the OSD cluster using the `AWSFederatedRole` definition.
4. Creates a unique AWS `Policy` if the `AWSFederatedRole` has `awsCustomPolicy` defined and attaches it to the Role.
5. Attaches any specified AWS Managed Policies to the `Role`.

### 3.5.1. Constants and Globals

None

### 3.5.2. Spec

```yaml
spec:
  awsCustomerCredentialSecret:
    name: {Name for secret with osdManagedAdmin credentials}
    namespace: {Namespace for the secret with osdManagedAdmin credentials}
  externalCustomerAWSIAMARN: arn:aws:iam::${EXTERNAL_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:user/${EXTERNAL_AWS_IAM_USER}
  awsFederatedRole:
    name: {Name of desired AWSFederatedRole}
    namespace: aws-account-operator
```

* `awsCustomerCredentialSecret` is the secret reference for the osdManagedAdmin IAM user in the AWS account where OSD is installed
* `externalCustomerAWSIAMARN` is the AWS ARN for the desired IAM user that will use the AWS role when created. This should be in an AWS account external to the one where OSD is installed.
* `awsFederatedRole` is the reference to the target `AWSFederatedRole` CR to create an instance of.

### 3.5.3. Status

```yaml
status:
  conditions:

    type: Ready
  consoleURL: https://signin.aws.amazon.com/switchrole?account=701718415138&roleName=network-mgmt-5dhkmd
  state: Ready
```

* `conditions` indicates the states the `AWSFederatedAccountAccess` had and supporting details
* `consoleURL` is a generated URL that directly allows the targeted IAM user to access the AWS `Role`
* `state` is the current state of the CR
